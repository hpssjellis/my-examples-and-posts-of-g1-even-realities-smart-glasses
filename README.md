## First impressions

1. Fancy beautiful packaging
2. great unpacking experience
3. onboarding was simple, did have to put them in and out of the case several times
4. Mixed feelings about the sunclips. I need them as I am sun sensitive but the price
 ~$300 CDN was a bit much for basically drugstore $20 clips. Not even magnetic attached
like my regular glasses.
1. Sad there was no option for auto shading photochromic or transition lens.
2. I could position them better but will let a optician do that and try to get them
3. to sell the glasses in Canada. I got mine from   [thespectaclefactory.com](https://www.thespectaclefactory.com/) in the UK. I sent them photos of my face with a ruler against my eyes so they could get the measurements

1. Every school district should have a non-prescription pair of these with a wifi only cell phone for teacher to try!
1. The dashboard widget allows showing: notes, stocks or news and whichever is showing your can tap right to scroll through them, but I would like to be able to scroll through all of the notes, stocks and news. That feels like a useful easy to fix software update.
1. Note the News is very nice as it updates live, but I really want to see my notes as that is a super useful part of the glasses especially while teaching.
1. i find the triple tap not very consistent.
1. maps does not play nice with my garmin watch sending a continuous stream of messages. I would really like a Garmin app that could do a few of the controls, such as A. leave the present app, B. wakeup, C. go to sleep, D. Activate last telepromptor.

Activation was easy just had to move it back and forth to the glasses case

What you actually see. Seems to float about 2 feet in-front of you. Is easier to see looking at a dark item, but completely readable even with a light item. The clarity is even better than this image I managed to take with my cell phone looking really close to the lens from the inside.

Before alignment right out of the box (a bit to high and slightly tiltled)
