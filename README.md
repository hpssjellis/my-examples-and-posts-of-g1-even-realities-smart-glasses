## First impressions

1. Fancy beautiful packaging
2. Great unpacking experience
3. Onboarding was simple, did have to put them in and out of the case several times
4. Mixed feelings about the sunclips. I need them as I am sun sensitive but the price
 ~$300 CDN was a bit much for basically drugstore $20 clips. Not even magnetic attached
like my regular glasses.
1. Sad there was no option for auto shading photochromic or transition lens.
2. I could position them better but will let a optician do that and try to get them
 to sell the glasses in Canada. I got mine from   [thespectaclefactory.com](https://www.thespectaclefactory.com/) in the UK. I sent them photos of my face with a ruler against my eyes so they could get the measurements




# April 22, 2025 second thoughts and images


1. Every school district should have a non-prescription pair of these with a wifi only cell phone for teacher's to try!
1. The dashboard widget allows showing: notes, stocks or news and whichever of those three are showing your can tap right or left to scroll forward or backward through them, but I would like to be able to scroll through all of the notes, stocks and news. That feels like a useful easy to fix software update.
1. Note the News is very nice as it updates live, but I really want to see my notes as that is a super useful part of the glasses especially while teaching.
1. I find the triple tap not very consistent.
1. Presently as I keep changing settings I find the glasses re-connect a bit but I think tha is all the changes I am making. I think I shouldput them in the case and restart each time I make a major change.
1. Maps does not play nice with my garmin watch sending a continuous stream of messages. I would really like a Garmin app that could do a few of the controls, such as A. leave the present app, B. wakeup, C. go to sleep, D. Activate last telepromptor.

Activation was easy just had to move it back and forth to the glasses case

What you actually see. Seems to float about 2 feet in-front of you. Is easier to see looking at a dark item, but completely readable even with a light item. The clarity is even better than this image I managed to take with my cell phone looking really close to the lens from the inside.

Before alignment right out of the box (a bit to high and slightly tiltled)

After alignment, the glasses are much nicer to wear and the multifocal presecription is perfect

I tried the expensive add-on the shades and they are really good

## April 23, 2025. Still learing, still really impressed

1. Sad to activate the teleprompter you have to go into the app. there is a setting to allow ouble tap to do that but then double tap does not exit other apps.
1. Trying to get used to the teleprompter being slightly above eye level. I get that it is probably a good thing as you can see your audience while reading the teleprompter but i feel that I am not looking at the camera and not making eye contact and it bothers me. I have tried changing the angles using the App, but that doesn't seem relevant. thinking of today bringing my glasses down for using the teleprompter.
1. I made a few videos, but I am so serious they are almost comical, (not sure if I can read and smile). I find the teleprompter switches to suto scroll from AI scroll. I really like AI scroll so have to check the app each time I start it.
1. With the glasses adjusted properly I am really impressed with how clear the multifocal lens is, it is slightly different than my Costco lens so I will have to change my angles a bit but that is not a fault in the lens. I like that the G1B is slightly bigger than the G1A as it gives you more periferal vision
1. I really like the note feature and may start using it daily.
1. I like that the notes can be added to the app even without wearing the glasses. many of the apps need the glasses on
1. I now understand the difference between a note and the transcribe feature. I originally thought they were kind of the same thing. The transcribe is half way between the Even AI and the note, giving you a bit of the best of both worlds. Unlike the Even AI which is a live LLM, with the transcribe you can make your note, then edit it and then send it to the LLM, (but only once for each note you tanscribe), say youo are making a lesson. you can then copy that AI output into the teleprompter for presentation.
1. major concern/confusion I was expecting my messages to show up, but I only see a bell with a number zero, the main message area shows my notes, I am not sure if this is a setup mistake on my part or if the glasses can't actually show my notifications just tell me that I have an amount of messages.
