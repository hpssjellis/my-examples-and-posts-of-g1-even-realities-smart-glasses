## My Main linkedin post about the G1B Smart Glasses




The main Linkedin Post is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7319089811049365506/) Check the comments for all other linkedIn posts about the G1 glasses. I call myself the Functional Futurist which aligns with having these glasses. They are really cool and I like that thye con't have a camera (battery life and updates to the camera)

## First impressions

1. Fancy beautiful packaging
2. Great unpacking experience
3. Onboarding was simple, did have to put them in and out of the case several times
4. Mixed feelings about the sunclips. I need them as I am sun sensitive but the price
 ~$300 CDN was a bit much for basically drugstore $20 clips. Not even magnetic attached
like my regular glasses.
1. Sad there was no option for auto shading photochromic or transition lens.
2. I could position them better but will let a optician do that and try to get them
 to sell the glasses in Canada. I got mine from   [thespectaclefactory.com](https://www.thespectaclefactory.com/) in the UK. I sent them photos of my face with a ruler against my eyes so they could get the measurements




# April 22, 2025 second thoughts and images


1. Every school district should have a non-prescription pair of these with a wifi only cell phone for teacher's to try!
1. The dashboard widget allows showing: notes, stocks or news and whichever of those three are showing your can tap right or left to scroll forward or backward through them, but I would like to be able to scroll through all of the notes, stocks and news. That feels like a useful easy to fix software update.
1. Note the News is very nice as it updates live, but I really want to see my notes as that is a super useful part of the glasses especially while teaching.
1. I find the triple tap not very consistent.
1. Presently as I keep changing settings I find the glasses re-connect a bit but I think tha is all the changes I am making. I think I shouldput them in the case and restart each time I make a major change.
1. Maps does not play nice with my garmin watch sending a continuous stream of messages. I would really like a Garmin app that could do a few of the controls, such as A. leave the present app, B. wakeup, C. go to sleep, D. Activate last telepromptor.
   



## April 23, 2025. Still learing, still really impressed

1. Sad to activate the teleprompter you have to go into the app. there is a setting to allow ouble tap to do that but then double tap does not exit other apps.
1. Trying to get used to the teleprompter being slightly above eye level. I get that it is probably a good thing as you can see your audience while reading the teleprompter but i feel that I am not looking at the camera and not making eye contact and it bothers me. I have tried changing the angles using the App, but that doesn't seem relevant. thinking of today bringing my glasses down for using the teleprompter.
1. I made a few videos, but I am so serious they are almost comical, (not sure if I can read and smile). I find the teleprompter switches to suto scroll from AI scroll. I really like AI scroll so have to check the app each time I start it.
1. With the glasses adjusted properly I am really impressed with how clear the multifocal lens is, it is slightly different than my Costco lens so I will have to change my angles a bit but that is not a fault in the lens. I like that the G1B is slightly bigger than the G1A as it gives you more periferal vision
1. I really like the note feature and may start using it daily.
1. I like that the notes can be added to the app even without wearing the glasses. many of the apps need the glasses on
1. I now understand the difference between a note and the transcribe feature. I originally thought they were kind of the same thing. The transcribe is half way between the Even AI and the note, giving you a bit of the best of both worlds. Unlike the Even AI which is a live LLM, with the transcribe you can make your note, then edit it and then send it to the LLM, (but only once for each note you tanscribe), say youo are making a lesson. you can then copy that AI output into the teleprompter for presentation.
1. major concern/confusion I was expecting my messages to show up, but I only see a bell with a number zero, the main message area shows my notes, I am not sure if this is a setup mistake on my part or if the glasses can't actually show my notifications just tell me that I have an amount of messages.
1. I now understand why the teleprompter has a width setting, it doesn't really make things bigger just reduces the column width so your eyes are not so obvious that you are reading things.
1. On the main page of the app is a settings icon top right which allows several things mainly the angle to lookup to see the dashboard but also the with and nearness of the screen which is really interesting as you can set it from 1 foot to about 5 feet away from you. My eyesite does not like the long range but the ability to do that is very cool.

## April 24th, 2025 Navigation while biking

1. I forgot my shades first ride, so looking up at a bright blue sky I could barely see the dashboard.
2. Liked the tap a part of the map to go there. Really smooth and fast
3. Turns easy to see, measurements looked accurate, side map was interesting not really sure my orientation on the side map
4. Look up for full map, very cool liked it alot. Not sure how long it stayed visible, obviously looking up would be dangerous for an extended time
5. When I messed up my route (on purpose) it recalculated the directions smoothly, but the main map did take a few views to complete the recalculation. I thought it froze, but it just took some time
6. Switching to silent mode when I needed to concentrate on safely riding, worked fine (3 taps either side)
7. Switching back to maps did not work. (DOES 3 TAPS GET OUT OF SILENT MODE?) I don't think that has ever worked for me.
8. 2 taps out of navigation worked and I could write a note or ask the LLM, which was a very cool feature I was not expecting
9. Sad that getting back into the navigation it had lost my end point. Easy to re-tap or re-click a saved location (probably a good idea to save your location because of this loosing location on exit)
10. Shades and increasing the brightness really helped for the main map on a bright day.
11. Sound was on by default, I get that is probably a good idea so that people know they can do sound, but each time I had to turn it off. In many ways sound is much safer than the visual map, I just really like seeing where I am going.
12. Not sure if the map is always visible or if a turn is not for several miels if it disappears. (I think that could be a setting some people would like.)
13. PROS: Navigation with the G1 is a amazing feature, easy to select, easy to see
14. CONS: Silent mode return, closing and returning to apps
15. SUGGESTIONS: have a map hide feature that is not silent mode, left or right single tap just hides the map for safety reasons. Allow returning from other apps to navigation


## Dashboard Thoughts


1. I lost my Garmin watch charge cable today, so I thought I would wear the G1's for the day, unfortunately I often use my watch to use the count down timer and the stop watch. I feel that those functions would be very useful in the G1's. Just a thought.
1. Wierd but if you take the glasses out of the case and wait about 15 s they start and seem fine, but until you actually connect them to your app the time is off. I will need to check if I leave these on longer if the time figures out what is correct.



## OMG Fitness

1. When I do 
situps I typically do between 6 and 10 minutes. Thought i would wear my G1's. I always put in an ear bud and while doing situps I wrote a note to remind me tomorrow about something and then I tried the Even AI for the lyrics to a familar song. OMG that was fun, using my Garmin to cycle through songs and the Even AI to show the lyrics and then try singing along to the songs (I have never been any good at remembering lyrics). I had so much fun I did 22 minutes of situp. Yes the wordds floated around and I needed to try to keep my head as still as possible but completely easy to sing along to a song and lose myself in the fun. I will need to take them for a run. I wonder how sweat resistant they are at the ears. Of course i wouldn't wear them if it was going to rain.
1. one main compalint about the Even AI is you can't activate the AI scrolling or even the speed of the auto scrolling. That seems like a software tweak that is do-able. The other option is to use the teleprompter and setup an entire playlist of songs that match the spotify playlist. You can download that from spotify for individual songs, not the whole playlist.
2. One weird thing about the green letters, I find they are really easy to remember for someone as visual as I am. They could be a serious learning aid.

## G1 for students
1. As a teacher I have spent the last 10 years saying cell phones are hurting students ability to concentrate long enough to learn how to computer code. So much so that I actually have a product to help teachers contain student cell phones without the teacher having to touch them (dropping and breaking a students cell phone would be a super pain). Anyway here is a link to my [no-touch cell phone lockers](https://www.amazon.ca/Generic-loc-ssb-v01-No-Touch-Phone-Locker/dp/B0D9MK345T)
2. My attitude in the classroom is that students spend the entire class learning curricular topics. That's it.
3. Some schools say giving students a flip phone is the answer, I am so against that.
4. What abouut students having the G1? Their cell phones can stay in thier bag or be locked up and the student has the ability to make notes, do presentations and use the Even AI to learn. No games, no social media just high level learning

## April 25th, 2025

1. I was in a 6:00 am zoom meeting today and a cmppany came up that I knew nothing about and I did a quick google / chatgpt search but didn't want to look away from the presenter while reading the reply. Why can't I beam the results to my glasses? Best from a webpage but also in the app I don't think there is a way to type what you want and have the EvenAI report that to the glasses. Seems like a simple improvement. Make the glasses useful when you can't speak. What about in a nosy environment like a rock concert or subway station, are the glasses useless if I can't speak. On the app you can?
2. Hack solution to the above issue. Go to chatGPT or a webpage, get your results, copy them to a new "teleprompt" then show from there, but the switching apps is irritating and feels clunky, better solution would be for EvenAI to have a text entry and easy result edit before the teleprompt part of EvenAI 
3. I am a bit to shy to make a video of me singing with the teleprompter working, but it really is amazing. For people like me who don't remember lyrics well it is so much fun to just sing along with a song. I will see if I can post a video, btu might not
4. These things are so amazing a night. The green text is so easy to read in the dark, to study a subject with them or practice a speach is really a pleasure in the dark. It almost would be an interesting feature on the G2 to have a front facing LED, that was easy to turn on. I find I am walking around the house in the dark and just want a light to see what is in fron of me.
5. HACK: The EVENAI is not great as a teleprompter but it is easy to copy the responsee and paste in in the teleprompter and quickly edit it, make sure AI-scrolling is on and then present it. This would be awesome for both teachers and students, to be able to present a concept with barely a few minutes prep.
6. I will try to make some videos. I just found out that I can't record on the same phone while playing a song and using the teleprompter, luckily I have a second phone just need to charge it.




## April 26th, 2025

1. When giving a speach (or singing) best to have the teleprompter mode open with AI scrolling activated, it is really good at finding out where you are in the speech except for when it gets too far ahead, that is when a quick look at what the app teleprompter is seeing is helpful. You can quickly move the speech down an inch or two and the AI scrolling then detects really well again.
2. I may have mentioned this before but I really want to do a speach with a lot of dryexpert information that I constantly go on tangents and then back to the speach with the AI scrolling detection working great.
3. Whent on a run I will upload the video soon
4. Made a spotify lyric playlist scrapper to copy the enitre playlist of scong lyrics into the teleprompter. [spotify00.html](https://hpssjellis.github.io/my-examples-and-posts-of-g1-even-realities-smart-glasses/spotify00.html)



## April 27, 2025
1. I finally figured out how to ajust the green screen so it was low and as big as possible. I think I will make a video about it. Funny how I totally did not understand the labels. I had to sit in front of a box (my TV) and line up the output and then make adjustments until I understood what was happening. The 5M adjustment is the biggest and the lower height is the lowest and easiet to see.
2. I finally figured out the triple tap to toggle silent mode. (I still want some way to easily and quickly hide the monitor briefly and bring it back where it last was). note:silent mode is a full resets for almost all apps, even the map is fully reset losing your last location which is why you should often save the location you want to go to. The only think that doesn't seem fully reset is your notes: if you werre on note 3/4 after re-activation you are still on the same note.


## May 2nd, 2025
1. Getting much better with the buttons. Can consistently triple tap for silent and activated mode.
2. Would really like a hide-screen mode not full silent. The hide screen mode would just hide the screen but not turn anything off. Very important for driving or riding to shut off the map screen at an intersection if things start to get tricky and you want to fully concentrate, but if you put silent mod eon with a triple tap, when you re-activate you have lost the map ability and need to pull over to get it working again using the app.
3. I have always had the dashboard set to quicknote display. very sad to find out it only shows 4 notes, however that does force me to display only 4 of the important notes and hide the other ones using the App. I am not sure why even realities did not use the same as the news feature and just load the next 4 notes as you get to the 4th one.
4. So I recently switched the dashboard to the news app. I AM SO ADDICTED TO THE NEWS APP, basically if you are ever bored look up and get an AI generated news tip from multiple sites based on what you want to see, I chose Science, each time you look up it shows the same news aarticle, but if you tap ( I swipe as it is fast and easy to do) you then get the next news story, after showing all 4 it then loads a new set of 4. This is amazing, and really useful and really addicting, no more boring meetings. I also used the app to lower the dashboard activation angle just to use the news app. Unlike a news app on your phone, this is a combined news app from multiple sources.
5. When in the news app I would like the left button long hold to activate the evenAI about the article you are reading and the right button hold to save the news article to your quicknotes. This activity should be doable since those long taps do not work when you are in the dawhboard state.
6. My present hack is I get out of the dashboard, hold the left button and ask evenAI about the news source and what I remember of the article and it generates fairly often what I am looking for, (I really struggle with the details of the news story and sending those details to EvenAI.
7. Finally the first real bug, I don't know what caused it but the fix was easy. I have had this a couple of times but din't know what was happening. It felt like the words of the dashboard were a little surreal, I thought my glasses were not aligned properly for one eye but not the other, what was happeing is both eyes were showing a different news item. I could prove it by closing one eye and then closing the other eye. easy fix was the right button to forward both sides to the correct news page. I could has also triple tapped and then tripple tapped again to reset things. If it happens again I will test what is the best way to fix it and possibly what causes it. It is a strange feeling having different text shinning into different eyes.


# May 8th, 2025
1. Found a weird bug in the quicknotes. somehow things are entered into the clipbaord and pasted when you move around. i will try to clarify when I figure it out
22.Try this. in a quicknote write a sentence like "This is really weird" then without hitting enter move your cursor to a new location within the quicknote and hit enter. the line gets copied to the new location and is still at the old location. this is definitely a bug. Not a deal breaker but a little weird. The effect does not happen if on the first entry you hit return before moving your cursor. soltuoon at the end of each line hit return, then no weird auto copy happens. 
3. A nice feature is that if you start and entry with a number each time you hit enter it makes the next number in the list. I am making ToDo and To Buy liats and then just deleting the entries but leaving the numbers. i will show what I mean in my video.
4. I eally like the quicknotes. They are my go-to organizer.
5. One trick enter a "1. " and a note. Then hit enter it auto adds the next number, but better yet, when you have completed that task, then just delete it but leave the number. Then it is ready for the next task. Sure this could be programmed better but it works and is really useful.
6. I still would like notes and stocks and news being able to be shown on the dashboard with a simple way to switch between them.



# May 11, 2024 G2 Suggestions:
1. making my suggested updates to the G1, may introduce other not thought of bugs, so I understand if Even Realities ignores my suggestions.
2. However the G2 glasses could be made with my suggestions and debugged to make a smoother process.
3. Promote no camera, camera drains battery and unless you have edge AI abilities needs a constant internet connection with band width issues
4. Eventually there will be a camera like a Garmin watch and earbuds that integrates seemlessly with these glasses
5. Conside adding an IMU motion sensor. This would give you much more control over inputs. Also coud be a setting or a quick flip to turn the IMU on or off to conserve battery. An IMU might also make it possible to view spreadsheets, by moving your head to view other parts of the document.  Here is a video I made years ago about using an IMU to write the letters WORDS so that you could write (well with just those those 5 letters but you get the concept video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA-MYG8vYeg&list=PL57Dnr1H_egsQPnEObWHPhK1Q4g_IDWcR&index=7) )
6. Consider a second screen at eye level. Since only one screen would work at a time it would not be an energy drain. I am curious if the second screen would really change the cost of the glasses dramatically
7. Have the G2 an advanced pair wiht a higher cost that allows the G1 to still be an entry level pair of smart glasses
8. Fix the touch abillity on the App. Strangely different than all other apps I have used, seems to need a longer or more solid touch on items.
9. Makes the dashboard better. It is good but could allow Notes, Stocks and News. Also for the continuous news have a long look up activate the dashboard as it now does, but a fast lookup-look-down activate the next news item. That way I would never have to touch the buttons to move between items.
10. Allow the transcribe to enter text and use the AI summary. I hack this by making a few blank entries which I can then edit and ask the AI and then read the results on my glasses
11. Fix switching between teleprompter EvenAI, Manual and auto modes. Herre is where an IMU motion senor might help to give people a bit more control
12. Add many more settings. Where they are needed is for the quick notes, and teleprompter giving better control without using the app
13. Consider an LED light that is easy to activate. Thesee glasses are so awesome at dusk or night or just around the housee without any lights on, that I often want to quickly see something but am really irritated by having to get my cell phone out and find the LED app, when a simple head movement could turn the light on and then the same movement to turn the light off.
14. Could any text based app be supported? Like the news and stocks just your own cell phone apps that present text?
15. 

# Summary 

My github Profile is at [https://github.com/hpssjellis](https://github.com/hpssjellis)

I have taught coding for other 3 decades. I taught myself how to code starting in 1977 using the [HP 67 and 97 programmable calulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-67/97) I taught myself Neural Networks, the present basis for Machine Learning and AI around 1990's using quick Pascal, but things never really worked well until Google released [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) in 2015 and ML took off. I teach a high school multi-year tested Robotics, IoT and Machine Learning course called [maker100](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker100-curriculum). For years I have felt that all high school and undergrad students should know hands on Robotics as well as their choosen fields. The rest of the world is starting to agree with me.

I am part of the [Harvard TinyML Admin team](https://tinyml.seas.harvard.edu/team) trying to bring tinyML to students in developing countries

I give blunt reviews not because I am mean, but because I want code to be as functional as possible. A pretty UI and well written and documentented code that is not functional, bothers me.

The Even Realities G1 series glasses are an excellent starting point into Smart Glasses and productivity. They are the best I have seen that have the potential to  allow you to be more productive in what you are trying to do.

What you actually see. Seems to float about 2 feet in-front of you. Is easier to see looking at a dark item, but completely readable even with a light item. The clarity is even better than this image I managed to take with my cell phone looking really close to the lens from the inside.
