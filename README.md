## First impressions

1. Fancy beautiful packaging
2. great unpacking experience
3. onboarding was simple, did have to put them in and out of the case several times
4. Mixed feelings about the sunclips. I need them as I am sun sensitive but the price
 ~$300 CDN was a bit much for basically drugstore $20 clips. Not even magnetic attached
like my regular glasses.
1. Sad there was no option for auto shading photochromic or transition lens.
2. I could position them better but will let a optician do that and try to get them
3. to sell the glasses in Canada. I got mine from   [thespectaclefactory.com](https://www.thespectaclefactory.com/) in the UK. I sent them photos of my face with a ruler against my eyes so they could get the measurements
